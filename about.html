                <h2>Hi, I'm Andrei Stephen Yap</h2>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™m a passionate Computer Science student currently studying at CIIT. CS101 has played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding of computing. 
                    My journey into the world of technology started with this course, which introduced me to the basics of hardware, software, and web design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside academics, I love engaging in creative hobbies like designing board games, card games, exploring gothic fashion, and embracing digital creativity through coding. 
                    My goal is to contribute to the tech industry, with aspirations to work for a leading company like Riot Games.
