                <h2>Insights on CS101 and the Computing World</h2>
                <p>
                    CS101, or Intro to Computing, is not just a course—it’s a gateway to understanding the dynamic and evolving world of technology.
                    It provides a strong foundation by exploring key research areas, the historical evolution of computing, and its applications in diverse fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this course, I developed essential technical skills, from mastering office productivity tools to understanding computer hardware and software.
                    Most importantly, CS101 bridges the gap between theory and practice, culminating in projects like this personal website. This assignment 
                    encouraged me to integrate design principles and functionality to create an engaging user experience.

                <p>
                    Beyond the coursework, I’ve gained a broader perspective on how computing drives innovation in industries like gaming, finance, and education.
                    CS101 has inspired me to delve deeper into areas such as web development, cybersecurity, and game programming, equipping me to make meaningful contributions 
                    in these fields.
